# Personal Budget Manager
In todayâ€™s complex financial world, managing personal finances has become a fundamental life skill. People of all ages often face challenges when trying to track how they spend their money, how much they earn, and how well they stick to a monthly budget. This is particularly important for young adults and students, who may be managing money on their own for the first time.

Inspired by real-world personal finance tools and educational initiatives on financial literacy, the Personal Budget Manager aims to simulate a simplified financial planner using C++ and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The main goal is to help users become aware of their income and expenses by categorizing them and monitoring their monthly financial balance.

This console-based application allows users to input their earnings and expenses, organize spending into categories (like rent, food, entertainment, etc.), and receive a summary that shows if they are staying within their budget limits.

Besides being a practical tool, this project serves as a learning opportunity to apply core programming concepts such as class design, encapsulation, composition, and dynamic data structures like vectors. It is also a stepping stone for anyone interested in developing more complex finance applications in the future.
